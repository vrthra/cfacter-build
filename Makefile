# =============================================================================
# This makefile is setup to build cfacter first building the
# cross-compiler suite (binutils, cross-compilers, cmake) followed by
# cfacter dependencies (boost, yaml, openssl)
# Threaded dependendencies are setup loosely following the opensolaris package
# maintainer best practices. Our directory structure is as follows
#
# ./
# ./source
# ./source/${arch:sparc,i386}.sysroot.tar.gz        -- contains sysroot headers
# ./source/<patches>
# ./source/$project_$version.tar.gz
# ./source/$project_$version/								-- generated from tar.gz
# ./build
# ./build/${arch:sparc,i386}
# ./build/${arch:sparc,i386}/$project_$version/
#
# The general steps (along with dependencies) are as follows (< needs)
#
# source/%.tar.gz
# 	< source/%/._.checkout
#	 		< source/%/._.patch
#	 			< source/%/._.config
#	 				< source/%/._.make
#	 					< source/%/._.install
